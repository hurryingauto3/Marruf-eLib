# Marruf - Electronic Book Management System 

Our product is a piece of software that solves a problem many students go through - the organization of digital books. It fills the absence of the void of a library-like software that stores all the digital books (pdf, ePubs, etc) with metadata. The user can read within the software. This makes it a very versatile product. Current products of this sort are either underdeveloped, highly-priced, or too old and dated.
